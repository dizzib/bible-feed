This app helps you keep track of your daily bible reading if you are using the Professor Grant Horner reading plan.

It removes the need for a printed sheet of paper or individual bookmarks.

Tap each of the 10 reading lists to mark them as read then wait for the lists to automatically advanced at midnight, or manually advance them immediately.

A linear indicator shows your progress in each list.

If you are already on the PGH plan and using this app for the first time, you can set it up with your current reading position: tap the up/down icon or long press a cell to bring up a dialog where you can update the book and chapter.

In Matthew 6:11 Jesus says "Give us this day our daily bread", so let us feed on it daily and DO what it says in obedience to our great God and Lord Jesus Christ, keeping His commandments to the end. Amen.
